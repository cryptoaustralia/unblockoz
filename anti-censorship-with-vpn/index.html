  <h2>Reclaim your Internet with VPNs</h2>
</div>

<p>
  Virtual Private Network (or VPN) is a service that encrypts your network
  traffic between your laptop and a remote server on the Internet. As VPNs have
  tunnelling capabilities, your Internet traffic remains hidden from your
  Internet Service Provider. This makes VPNs a useful companion for evading
  Internet censorship.
</p>

<p>
  As VPN is a service, it needs to be operated by someone. It can be either
  self-hosted or ran by a third-party. If you are a beginner, we advise you
  to rely on a VPN provider with a user-friendly privacy policy.

      Bitmask is an open source application to provide easy and secure encrypted

      through the provider before it is decrypted and sent on to the
      open Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development of Bitmask is supported by <a href="https://riseup.net/">Riseup</a>,
      which advocates for the freedom of expression and such since 1999. Be
      careful, however, because the actual VPN service is provided by
      third-parties.

  Be careful when choosing a hosting provider running your VPN service. Firstly,
  avoid OpenVZ virtualisation as this technique is known to have problems with
  IPSEC tunnels. Secondly, hosting providers may take snapshots of your servers
  when presented with a warrant. Always check their privacy policy whenever
  possible.
